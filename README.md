# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

## üìñ Introduction
This project showcases my learning journey in:
- **Machine Learning**: Applying models(Support Vector Machine,Decision Tree,Random Forest, KNN,Logistic Regression,..) to solve regression and classification tasks.
- **Deep Learning**: Exploring optimization algorithms to improve model performance.

### Applications:
1. **Stock Prediction**:
   - Using RNN , FFNN and (Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression,Random Forest,Decision Tree)  to predict stock prices.
2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**:
   - Predicting voice activity using CNN-BiLSTM models.
3. **Wine quality classification**
   - Using many models of machine learning.
4. **Handwriting classification**
   - Using CNN and other optimal methods (Adam,RMSprop,Gradient Descent,...)
  
   
## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Implementation of machine learning models for regression and classification.
- Development and optimization of deep learning models.
- Application-specific tasks:
  - Stock price prediction.
  - Voice activity detection (VAD).



## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To run the project, you need:
- **Python** 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch`
  - `matplotlib` or `seaborn`

## üöÄ Usage
- You can run on Google Colab .
- It has two files : DeepLearning.ipynb and Project.ipynb
- You can read content about them at report (.docx)

## üìä Results

1. **Stock Prediction**:
   - Comparative performance of RNN and FFNN models.
   - Visualized stock price trends and prediction accuracy.
2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**:
   - Model evaluation through metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy.
3. **Wine quality classification**
   - Compare evaluate (MSE, MAE, RMSE,R^2) for regression and (accuracy,loss) for classification.
4. **Handwriting classification**
   - Using CNN and other optimal methods (Adam,RMSprop,Gradient Descent,...)
  
## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

- Enhance Voice Activity Detection with deep learning models.
- Experiment with advanced optimization algorithms for better performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Stock Prediction**: The model may not predict accurately during periods of high volatility or significant market fluctuations.
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: The detection only identifies audio presence (sound) and does not differentiate between speech and other types of sound.
